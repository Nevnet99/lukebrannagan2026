The `BreadCrumb` component provides users with a persistent sense of location. It is designed to be **sticky**, staying pinned below the main navigation to provide context and utility actions (like sharing) during long reads.

---

### Usage

The component is primarily used in layout files or top-level page templates. It mimics a file system path (e.g., `~/portfolio / blog / ...`) to align with the developer aesthetic.

<div class="p-6 border border-text/10 rounded-lg not-prose bg-background/50 overflow-hidden">
  <BreadCrumb 
    items={[{ label: "~", href: "/" }, { label: "blog", href: "/blog" }]} 
    currentFile="trading-engine.md"
  />
</div>

```jsx
import BreadCrumb from '../../components/ds/BreadCrumb.astro';

<BreadCrumb 
  items={[
    { label: "~", href: "/" },
    { label: "projects", href: "/projects" }
  ]} 
  currentFile="matching-engine.go"
/>
```
### Features

#### Sticky Positioning 
The component is pinned to top-[64px] (assuming a standard 64px main navbar). It uses backdrop-blur to ensure content scrolling underneath remains legible but secondary.

#### Action Slots

The component includes a right-aligned <slot name="actions" />. This is perfect for contextual buttons like "Share," "Edit on GitHub," or "Download PDF."

<div class="p-6 border border-text/10 rounded-lg not-prose bg-background/50">
  <BreadCrumb
  items={[{ label: "src", href: "#" }]}
  currentFile="resume.pdf"
  >
    <Button slot="actions" size="sm" variant="secondary" icon={Share2}>
      Share
    </Button>
  </BreadCrumb>
</div>

```jsx
<BreadCrumb items={items} currentFile="post.md">
  <button slot="actions">
    Share
  </button>
</BreadCrumb>
```

#### Responsive Pathing

The currentFile segment automatically truncates on mobile devices to prevent layout breaking, while the parent breadcrumbs remain accessible.

##### Technical Details
The component relies on z-index: 20 to sit above standard page content but below the primary site header (z-30).

Warning: When using this component, ensure your page headings have a scroll-margin-top of at least 10rem (160px) to prevent them from being hidden behind the double-sticky header stack.


### Props 

Prop | Type | Default | Description
--- | ---- | ------- | -----------
items | `Array<{label, href}>`| [] | The path segments leading to the current page.
currentFile | string | undefined | The final segment, visually highlighted as the active file.
slot="actions" | slot | undefined | Right-aligned area for buttons or utility links.
