Let’s get started with the _why_.

Most of my hobbies involve my hands. I play guitar and have done so for close to 20 years now. For my job, I am a Software Developer, so most of my days are spent typing. I am either writing lots of documentation or actually programming. On top of that, most of my leisure time is spent gaming.

That leaves a lot of room for RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) to sneak into my life and basically ruin it.

## The Warning Signs

My hands have always been cold, or at least hard to warm up. If I had a long gaming session or a heavy coding sprint without breaks, my hands would freeze up and take a while to move.

Imagine a sloth moving. That is what happened to my hands. I would have to stop for around 15 minutes and massage them just to get them moving at normal speed again.

## The Keyboard Journey

I should start by admitting that I have been addicted to buying fancy keyboards for quite a while now. Here is the list of what I have tried, in order:

1. **Keychron K3**
2. **Keychron Q1**
3. **Ultimate Hacking Keyboard (UHK)**
4. **Glove80** (Current)
5. **Corne** (Coming soon)

The first step was switching from a traditional staggered keyboard (which is bad for posture and wrists). That was when I bought the **Ultimate Hacking Keyboard**. It was a pretty sweet change, but it had two large downsides for me:

1. **Interference:** Any electronic device near it caused the keyboard to go mental, turning off and on. It was not a great experience.
2. **Staggered Layout:** It was still staggered, so it did not fix my hands freezing up.

That made me want to move to something that had two specific features: an **Ortholinear layout** (keys in a grid) and **tenting** (focus on ergonomics).

So, I got a **Glove80**. Don't get me wrong. This keyboard solved my issues. My hands don't freeze up anymore, and I am very comfortable using it. However, I am looking to switch again for two reasons:

1. **Too many keys:** I barely use half of them because I rely heavily on layers.
2. **Portability:** Travelling with this keyboard is near impossible; the travel case is larger than my backpack.

I am now looking to move to a **Corne**. It is basically the same concept but without the keywell and with far fewer keys, which should hopefully make my fingers less confused when gaming.

## Why I chose Colemak DH

When I decided to switch layouts, I looked for a few specific things:

- **Minimal finger movement.**
- **Good support** in the Glove80 keymappings.
- **Compatibility** with common programs like Vim.

There was one last factor: it was the first one I found that I really meshed with ideologically.

## The Switch: FAQ

Switching was brutal. If you are just reading this for the common questions, here is the breakdown so you can breeze through:

- **How long did it take to catch QWERTY?** It took about two months of practicing, anywhere from one to three hours a day. Total time was about **70 hours** of typing to get back to my QWERTY speed of 80 WPM.
- **Did you improve?** Yes. With Colemak DH, I can type around **120 WPM** if I am trying, and typically **105 WPM** at a normal, relaxed pace.
- **Did it stop the pain?** Yes, 100%. I no longer move my hands as much, and I find it much more comfortable to type.
- **What tools did you use?** I used **Keybr** to learn the muscle memory, and then **Monkeytype** (English 1k, 5k, 10k, and 25k) to ramp up the difficulty and learn chords.
- **Can you still type in QWERTY?** Yes. I am not slower, nor have I forgotten anything. If I need to jump on a laptop or use my phone, I am absolutely fine.

## The Learning Process

I spent most of my time at the start on **Keybr.com**. It is vital for learning where the keys have moved to.

**Pro tip:** It is much easier to do this with blank keycaps. Looking at your keyboard is a very bad habit. I suggest displaying the keymap on another monitor instead.

I spent about a month on Keybr running the learning test. Eventually, I focused on tricky letters. For me, `P` and `B` were extremely annoying to wrap my head around. After practicing those specific words, I am now very proficient.

After Keybr, I moved to **Monkeytype**. I hammered the "English" category for a good thousand tests, gradually moving up the difficulty settings until I hit 120 WPM.

## The Problems

It isn't all sunshine and rainbows.

**1. Gaming sucks.** This might be partially due to my specific keymap and layers, but I currently use a dedicated gaming layer on the Glove80 and find it a nightmare. I make do, but I still find myself blundering and pressing the wrong keys quite often.

**2. Flow typing is... boring.** In QWERTY, you get used to a "flow state" where you feel like your hands are flying across the keyboard. With Colemak DH, that is a thing of the past. Your hands are static most of the time. Even when you are in flow, it feels efficient but static. It is hard to get into a rhythm when your hands barely move.

**3. I stopped using Vim.** I used to exclusively use Neovim for coding. However, after switching to Colemak, I haven't managed to pick it back up. The navigation keys (`H`, `J`, `K`, `L`) are in different spots, and the muscle memory is incredibly confusing. I am not interested in remapping everything in Vim, so I am stuck. I am hoping that with a smaller keyboard (the Corne), I will have a better layer setup and can attempt moving back to Vim.

## Would I do it again?

Yes.

Despite the trade-offs with gaming and Vim, it is well worth it to save my hands. As long as you are willing to put in the time. It is not a quick process, and it can be frustrating at times, but the end result is worth it. I am now able to type comfortably for hours without any pain or discomfort, which is a huge win for me.
